      "body": "A trip to Spain is hard to describe in words, because the experience of the country is so visceral, so tactile. You don’t just “see” Spain, you experience it, with hearing, taste, smells, everything. The Iberian Peninsula has been a unique location in Europe since the Middle Ages, and that caused Spain to develop a culture that’s simultaneously European and singularly Spanish. The weather here is, like it’s people, smooth and steady and welcoming, making Spain a year-round destination for college travelers. So whether you decide to go during Spring Break or right before your next semester starts, Spain will be great. Fiestas, carnivals, and holy weeks cram the Spanish calendar year, so no matter when you go there’s an event going on somewhere. Read our Spain Travel Guides, travel to Spain, and learn what this colorful, lively country has to offer.

Southern Italy’s rising star has ancient farmland hemmed by a sun-bleached sandy coast and is where travellers come to escape the frenetic vibe of nearby Tuscany.This year the region’s beautiful range of private villas, many with private pools and always with gorgeous views, will be particularly popular, as it allows social distancing without compromising on the joy of travel.",
